# Aquabot-Roboponics-Code-Repository

This repository is divided into three folders:
	
	1. Example Code: Contains example code for sensors, wifi module, stepper motors, and camera.
			These were mostly found either online or examples in libraries
	2. Libraries: Contains a library that I wrote to simplify the main program (Automation.ino).
	3. Working Code: Contains modifications of example code, usually a frankenstein combo of multiple exaple codes.		
			
			

Important Notes:		
Make sure to download any libraries the program.(#include "SdFat.h") Aquabot.h shouldnt require any additional libraries.
Make sure to make this accessable to Arduino.exe by adding it to /Documents/Arduino/libraries
The Arduino program needs to be closed and reopened to reload the libaries if changes are made to the library.
